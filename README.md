# Natours 2.0
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tour-booking website built using the *MVC architecture* with *RESTful API design* and developed with features like filtering, sorting, aliasing and pagination.
The server-side website rendering was done with *Pug templates*. \
&nbsp;&nbsp; There is *JWT authentication*: user sign up, log in, password reset, secure cookies, Node.js security and payments using *Stripe API*. \
CRUD operations with *MongoDB* and *Mongoose* locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud).
There's also advanced data modelling: embedding and referencing.
